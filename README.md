I want to apply this technique to my digital art design because it allows me to create visually captivating composite images. By overlaying two different images, I can convey multiple layers of meaning and emotion. Double exposure also provides room for interpretation by the audience, enhancing interactivity and fostering a deeper connection with viewers.

As for the coding technique, I can utilize programming languages such as JavaScript or Python along with image processing libraries like Pillow (Python) or the Canvas API (JavaScript) to automate and customize the creation of double exposure effects. 
And here are some links I can learn.
