# Final Assignment
Description of the animation\
For my project, I've chosen Audio function to animate my work. I use Microphone Input method and FFT method to control the height of the deepmountains based on changes in audio frequency (audio input from the microphone).\

Here is the original group work\

If viewers click anywhere of the canvas, it will play the music and the mountain height will change with the audio frequency. At the same time, viewers can clap, laugh, talk to make noise to control the height of the mountain. \

The louder the sound picked up by the microphone system, the higher the mountain will be.\
